## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up Vercel Blob Storage:**

   **Step 1:** Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login

   **Step 2:** In your Vercel dashboard, go to the **Storage** tab (or visit [vercel.com/dashboard/stores](https://vercel.com/dashboard/stores))

   **Step 3:** Click **Create Database** or **Create Store**, then select **Blob**

   **Step 4:** Give your blob store a name (e.g., "food-photo-log") and select a region

   **Step 5:** After creating the store, you'll see a page with connection details. Look for **Environment Variables** section

   **Step 6:** Copy the value of `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (it will look like `vercel_blob_rw_...`)

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   **Step 1:** Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   touch .env.local
   ```

   **Step 2:** Add your token to `.env.local`:
   ```
   BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_your_token_here
   ```

   **Note:** Replace `vercel_blob_rw_your_token_here` with the actual token you copied from Vercel

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser
